# Overview

The project will focus around creating a simple platforming game in Python using the arcade library. The user will be able to control the character sprite and interact with objects on the screen in order to jump over an object or "get" a coin to increase the player score.

The purpose of thise project is to help with my personal development of creating video games. While my primary professional skill in programming is web development, I have been gaining more interest in learning how to develop games as a hobby. This project is a step towards creating a base knowledge for where to start and where to build off of in the future.
